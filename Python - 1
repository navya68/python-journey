# My First Step in Python 🐍

Hi there! 👋  

I’m starting this repository to share what I’m learning about Python — and I thought, why not begin at the very beginning: **its history**.  
Before diving into writing code, I wanted to know *where Python came from* and *why it’s so popular today*.

## 📜 A Brief History of Python

Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s and officially released in **1991**.  
He wanted a language that was:

- Easy to read  
- Quick to write  
- Powerful enough to solve real-world problems  

And that’s exactly what Python became.  

**Timeline:**

- **Late 1980s** – Guido starts developing Python at CWI in the Netherlands.  
- **1991** – Python 0.9.0 is released with core features like functions, exception handling, and data types.  
- **2000** – Python 2.0 arrives, introducing list comprehensions and garbage collection.  
- **2008** – Python 3.0 launches with cleaner syntax and better Unicode support (but not backward compatible).  
- **Today** – Python is everywhere: web development, data science, AI, automation, and more!

## 🚀 What’s Next?

This is just the beginning of my Python journey.  
I’ll be adding more notes, examples, and projects as I learn.  

Stay tuned! 😊
